RowdyRobo: Nice Job! You should've discovered the [wave]RANDOM algorithm[/wave], a common algorithm that is amazing at getting around odd shaped rooms 
#else: 
	#RowdyRobo: Hi there, {{Global.current_student.first_name}}, I'm RowdyRobo, your coding buddy! Welcome to my world! Let's work together to learn some algorithms [wait=1] (and clean up a little, while we are at it) 
- Next
RowdyRobo: This is the warehouse!
- What is this?
RowdyRobo: The warehouse is your space to develop your own special algorithm!
- Great!
RowdyRobo: You should try to [wave]generalize[/wave] your algorithm so that it can work for as many rooms as possible!
- I can try?
RowdyRobo: Great! You should play around with some of the other blocks that we havent used so far.
- I'm ready! => END!
